Initializing git folder
    1. In CodingNomads folder, create new folder git_practice
    2. Inside git_practice:
        a. Initialize folder as a git folder (make sure you are in the correct folder when initializing) by running
            the "git init" command within the git_practice folder.
        b. Make new file
        c. Add file
        d. Commit file
        c. On Github, create new git_practice repository
        d. Add this new GitHub repository as a new "remote" to your local Git repo. You can do this by using the command
            git remote add <ANY_NAME> <URL_OF_NEW_GITHUB_REPO.git>
        d. Push commit file to Github
